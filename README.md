# Welcome to my profile
My name is Trevor, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

My interest in computers started with video games and I started learning how to program when I was 13. I've learned so much since then and have recently taken an interest in data analysis. I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera.com.
